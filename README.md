## Why did I even make this?
1. I need a site that showcases my projects so far, because I forget everything so this site helps keep track
2. Share my achievements/progress with friends and future employers possibly..
3. Good practice for HTML, CSS and JS skills
4. I learned how to use Sass and create animations for this! It was pretty cool and simple

## Features:
- Hello scroll animation
- Light/dark mode
- Progress bar (who doesn't love a simple lil progress bar)
- Blog section
- Project gallery page
